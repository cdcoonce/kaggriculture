"""Chassis v1 — wheat rush + goose + melon satellite + animal husbandry +
index-0 price-aware selling.

Composition per turn: parse the obs into a typed view, run the (idempotent)
daily planner, dispatch units, build market orders with sells ahead of buys
and crashables at index 0. A soft watchdog bails to PASS if a turn ever runs
long — the 60 s overage bank is for thinking, never for accidents.
